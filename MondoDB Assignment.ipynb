    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) database management system. It uses a document-oriented data model, which means data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is designed for scalability, performance, and ease of development.\n",
    "- **Non-relational databases**: Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, store and retrieve data in formats other than traditional tabular relations used in relational databases. They are schema-less and typically offer high scalability and flexibility. NoSQL databases are suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "- **Scenarios to use MongoDB over SQL databases**:\n",
    "  - When dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data.\n",
    "  - When scalability and flexibility are more critical than strict data consistency.\n",
    "  - When rapid development and iteration are required.\n",
    "  - When handling large amounts of data that require horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- **Document-Oriented**: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.\n",
    "- **Schema-less**: MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for easy and dynamic data model changes.\n",
    "- **High Scalability**: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, enabling distribution of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "- **High Performance**: MongoDB uses internal memory mapping for data storage, providing fast access to data.\n",
    "- **Rich Query Language**: MongoDB supports a powerful query language with features like aggregation, indexing, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "- **High Availability**: MongoDB provides features like replica sets and automatic failover to ensure high availability and data redundancy.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: MongoDB supports various types of indexes to improve query performance.\n",
    "- **Ad Hoc Queries**: MongoDB allows for ad hoc queries, enabling developers to query data without predefining them.\n",
    "- **Flexible Deployment**: MongoDB can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or as a managed service.\n",
    "- **Automatic Load Balancing**: MongoDB automatically balances the data distribution across shards in a sharded cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection to MongoDB server\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create or access database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create or access collection\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "mydict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"address\": \"Highway 37\"}\n",
    "x = mycol.insert_one(mydict)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted ID:\", x.inserted_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "mylist = [\n",
    "  {\"name\": \"Amy\", \"address\": \"Apple st 652\"},\n",
    "  {\"name\": \"Hannah\", \"address\": \"Mountain 21\"},\n",
    "  {\"name\": \"Michael\", \"address\": \"Valley 345\"},\n",
    "]\n",
    "x = mycol.insert_many(mylist)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted IDs:\", x.inserted_ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print inserted record using find_one()\n",
    "print(\"Inserted Record:\")\n",
    "print(mycol.find_one({\"_id\": x.inserted_ids[0]}))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print all inserted records using find()\n",
    "print(\"All Inserted Records:\")\n",
    "for record in mycol.find():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query documents from a collection based on specified criteria.\n",
    "- The criteria can be specified using a query document, which is a JSON-like object.\n",
    "- The `find()` method returns a cursor object, which can be iterated to access the documents.\n",
    "- Example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Query documents where the name is \"John\"\n",
    "result = mycol.find({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print matching documents\n",
    "for document in result:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to sort the documents returned by a query based on one or more fields.\n",
    "- It takes one parameter, a sort specification document that defines the sorting order for the fields.\n",
    "- The sort specification document consists of field-value pairs, where the field is the field name to sort by, and the value is either 1 (ascending) or -1 (descending).\n",
    "- Example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sort documents by the \"name\" field in ascending order\n",
    "result = mycol.find().sort(\"name\", 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print sorted documents\n",
    "for document in result:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- `delete_one()`: This method is used to delete a single document that matches the specified criteria from a collection. If multiple documents match the criteria, only the first matching document will be deleted.\n",
    "- `delete_many()`: This method is used to delete multiple documents that match the specified criteria from a collection. All documents that match the criteria will be deleted.\n",
    "- `drop()`: This method is used to drop an entire collection from the database. It removes all documents and indexes associated with the collection, effectively deleting the collection itself."
